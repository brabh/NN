AI involves developing machines that can perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence. ML is the ability for these machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. And deep learning is a subfield of ML specifically concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

# NN
High performance C++ feed forward neural network with variable topology.
This can be seen as starting point for research and application of feed forward neural networks 
especially in time critical scenarios.
